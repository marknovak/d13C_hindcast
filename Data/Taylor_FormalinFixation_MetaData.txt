***
Due to autoloader and combustion malfunctions, some samples carbon or nitrogen values were not accurately measure. The second run enabled us to complete our dataset and to measure a number of individual’s δ13C values a second time across multiple timepoints. Having two measurements of the same individual at the same timepoint gave us greater ability to evaluate the variation between runs at the same lab on the same Stable Isotope Mass Spectrometer (SIMS).
